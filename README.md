# SimplyJS
### A Simple Tool for Complex Things. Well, Complex Things in JavaScript.
---

### What's SimplyJS?
SimplyJS is an open-source tool built to allow huge feature sets to be compressed down and made ready for you in a simple JavaScript library where you control what you need downloaded. With more and more features slowly being added and community additions being easy as pie (links coming soon), SimplyJS will be the only JS library you ever need.

### When is SimplyJS going to be done?
SimplyJS does not have an official, scheduled launch date as of this time. However, the most general forecast that can be made is the release being in Summer 2020.

### How do I learn how to use what's already here?
You can access [the code documentation/wiki here](https://github.com/doamatto/Simply.JS/wiki), which tells you everything you need to know on how to start using SimplyJS, as well as anything to help get things working quickly and easily.
